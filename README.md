# CSC-2342
All of my code from my CSC-2342 programming class.

This is a repository with all code written during my time in the course CSC-2342, which is the Discrete Structures course for Computer Science at High Point University.

Labs were used to test recently intruced concepts in a group setting where collaboration was encouraged.
